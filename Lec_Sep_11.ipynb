    "When you evaluate an arithmetic expression, you get arithmetic value back. Consider the following expression\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "y = x**2 + (3 * x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to evaluate the value of `y` when `x = 3`, I need to replace `x` in the equation with 3 and solve to get the value of `y`. Here the operators are `**`, `+`, and `*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar manner, evaluating boolean expressions results in getting boolean values (i.e., `True` or `False`). Boolean expressions are very powerful and can model almost all of decision making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two types of boolean expressions: the ones with the comparsion operators (`<`,`>`, `<=`, `=>`, and so on) and the ones with the boolean operators - `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
